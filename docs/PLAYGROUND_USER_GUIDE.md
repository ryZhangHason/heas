# HEAS Playground User Guide (v1.0.0)

## Workflow
1. Choose a preset (`Sample Usage 1` or `Sample Usage 2`) or open `Customize Settings`.
2. Adjust stream parameters and controls (`steps`, `episodes`, `seed`).
3. Run simulation and inspect validation/runtime messages if present.
4. Review `Results` tabs: overview, per-step, scenario comparison, interpretation.
5. Export a `Publication Bundle` for reproducibility.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` via static server.
2. Wait until status is `ready.`.
3. Run with 20 steps / 3 episodes for Sample 1.
4. Export and keep the generated JSON bundle with run facts.

## Import/Share
- `Import Bundle` supports V2 and auto-migrates V1 payloads.
- `Copy Share Link` serializes config for URL-based sharing.
- For large payloads, use `Export Publication Bundle` instead of URL links.
